This project contains the main bulk of the work for my MScEng in Mathematical Modelling at DTU.

It contains algorithms for computing the Wasserstein distance in 2d and 3d. It also contains algorithms for doing Wasserstein interpolations as well as novel grouping based on geometric similary by combining multidimensional scaling with Wasserstein distance matrices. It also contains code for visualising 3d probability distributions and generating GIFs showcasing Wasserstein interpolations.
